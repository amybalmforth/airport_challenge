AIRPORT CHALLENGE

My approach

1st user story:

*Plane* needs to *land* at an *airport*.

2nd user story:

*Plane* needs to *take off* from an *airport*
and *confirm it is no longer in the airport*

3rd user story:

*Prevent takeoff* when *weather* is *stormy*

4th user story:

*Prevent landing* when *weather* is *stormy*

5th user story:

*Prevent landing* when *airport* is *full*

6th user story:

Give a *default* *airport capacity* that can be *overridden*
