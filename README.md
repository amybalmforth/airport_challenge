This is my version of the Makers Academy airport challenge. User stories completed:

```
Plane needs to land at an airport

Plane needs to take off from an airport and confirm it is no longer in the airport

Prevent landing when airport is full
```

The next feature I would implement is to prevent a plane landing at an airport when the weather is stormy.
